# 2025-Python-Practice
This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed while learning Python throughout 2025. I began programming on September 1, 2025, motivated by a goal to pursue a career as a low-latency backend developer in quantitative finance.
The files from Chapter 1-14 have been copied from the pcc_3e repository as my files for Chapter 1-14 had been completely wiped while trying to move files around.
